## Project Overview

The aim of the project is to create a web application to play TicTacToe against a pre-trained reinforcement learning algorithm. Users will be able to take part in a competition. The progress of the game and personal information are stored in a database. In the current configuration the result of each games will sent to the user by email.


## Goals
- Create a functional version and depoly it online
- Connect backend (algorithm and database) and frontend (website)
- Improve the algorithm: 
    - The current algorithm isn't accurate and sufficient yet
- Improve the structre and code
    - Use a more object oriented style for more modularity 
    - Refactor: improve code usability and readability
- Testing: 
    - Create unit tests
    - Add Exception and handle errors
- Design:
    - Make design more responsive
    - Works in Desktop and Mobile view


## Setup
For an overview for required packages see [requirements](requirements.md)
